# Govbase
Govbase is an open, crowdsourced database of projects and tools in online governance.

This repository contains code, visualizations, schemas, and other stuff related to Govbase. The actual data is (currently) hosted on Airtable, at https://airtable.com/shrgnUrj0dqzZDsOd. For an editable view, please contact Josh explaining what you would like to contribute.

There is an API, however to access it you will need an Airtable account and editor access (Airtable will generate a key for you). You can see the API documentation here: https://airtable.com/appx3e9Przn9iprkU/api/docs.
