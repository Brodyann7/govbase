# Govbase Online Constitutions

The Govbase Online Constitutions data set consists of a number of constitutions written for blockchains, DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations), and other online communities. Many constitutions have been processed using the [Constitute Project](https://www.constituteproject.org) ontology, allowing them to be compared directly with Constitute's data set of over 200 national constitutions. 

If you would like upload the constitution of your online community, please submit a pull request to add a file to this folder.
